Videittous
==========

You can try it [here](https://vide.ittous.com)

Videittous is a browser based video optimizer. By relying on
[@ffmpeg/ffmpeg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ffmpeg/ffmpeg) it will take any
input video you have in any format understood by FFMpeg and it will produce an
mp4 which can be played in almost any device.

In order to be extremely easy to use by non technical people, it is very
opinionated on the encoding parameters and process.

This is just another weekend side project I built to learn about:

- [@ffmpeg/ffmpeg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ffmpeg/ffmpeg)
- [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [XState](https://xstate.js.org/)
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
